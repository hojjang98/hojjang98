# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Hojun Choi (hojjang98)

Iâ€™m steadily building my path toward becoming a data scientist â€” one experiment, one lesson, and one repo at a time.  
Hereâ€™s where I share my learning journey through hands-on projects and continuous exploration.

## ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On
- ðŸ§  Building end-to-end machine learning pipelines (EDA â†’ modeling â†’ tuning â†’ evaluation)
- ðŸ“¸ Working on real-time image classification with CNNs and OpenCV
- ðŸ§ª Studying core deep learning concepts through chapter-based notebook projects
- ðŸŽ“ Attending university courses with focus on AI, statistics, and data science foundations
