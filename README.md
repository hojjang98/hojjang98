# 👋 Hi, I'm Hojun Choi (hojjang98)

I’m steadily building my path toward becoming a data scientist — one experiment, one lesson, and one repo at a time.  
This is where I share my journey through hands-on projects, structured paper reviews, and daily idea generation.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- 🧠 Building end-to-end machine learning pipelines (EDA → modeling → tuning → evaluation)  
- 📸 Real-time image classification with CNNs and OpenCV  
- 🧪 Deep learning experiments from textbooks and papers  
- 🎓 Strengthening AI, statistics, and data science foundations through coursework

## 🛤️ Learning Journey
Every repo is a checkpoint in my growth:  
- **Early experiments** → quick EDA, visualization, first ML models  
- **Research notes** → in-depth paper reviews, structured markdown logs  
- **Full projects** → end-to-end pipelines, deployable apps, competition work
